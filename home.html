            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Good day! My name is Yernar, the simplest guy who has ever seen the world. I was born in a small town of Semey, and since childhood I have been distinguished by my character and mental abilities. At the moment, I am studying at one of the best universities in the country, Astana IT University. Currently, I manage to study and work in parallel. I work at TOO AltCom, holding the position of system administrator. I can repair equipment, consult on the choice of equipment, install telephone and local networks, set up the Internet, and many other things without which a person cannot imagine life these days.</p>
